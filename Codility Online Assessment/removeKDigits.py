"""
Given a positive number N, the target is to find the largest number that can be formed after removing any K digits from N.
Examples: 

Input: N = 6358, K = 1 
Output: 658

Input: N = 2589, K = 2 
Output: 89

Approach

- Iterate a loop K times.
- During every iteration, remove every digit from the current value of N once and store the maximum of all the numbers obtained.
- In order to achieve this, we store the maximum of (N / (i * 10)) * i + (N % i) where i ranges from [1, 10l â€“ 1] where l denotes the number of digits of the current value of N.
- Consider this maximum as the current value of N and proceed to the next iteration and repeat the above step.
- Thus, after every iteration, we have the least digit from the current value of N removed. On repeating the process K times, we obtain the largest number possible.
